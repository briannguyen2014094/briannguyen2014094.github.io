### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    My favorite part of Lab 6 is part 2 where we all had to work on the functions and main function for the blackjack hand. At first, the functions were confusing to work on. I learned that each function was much simpler than anticipated.


* Lab 7

    For me, Lab 7 was a surprising challenge and it shouldâ€™ve been easier than anticipated. When I was working on it, there was 1 part and it took a while but it felt good to complete since it was confusing to me. Although this lab was like this, it is still one of my favorites this semester.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 is also one of my favorites. Both parts took me by surprise but me and my partner ended up completing the lab in the little class time we had. It taught me a lot about how to create working functions and work around nested for loops.
